Let's go to the Beach!
THE CHALLENGE
                  Build a tool for beach-goers to monitor for hazards and to alert them
                  of precautionary measures for protection on their swim- and surf-filled
                  adventures!

According to the World Health Organization [1], overexposure to
sunlight can cause harm to our skin, our eyes, and our immune
systems. In fact, protecting ourselves from UV damage, for example
by using hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, can prevent four out of
five cases of skin cancer.Additionally, harmful algal blooms (HABs) can also pose a threat at
your next beach trip. According to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, HABs occur when colonies of algae in the sea and in
freshwater grow out of control [2]. They can produce toxins that
cause rashes, breathing problems, and liver damage [3]. Satellite-
based images of ocean color can help forecast the presence of HABs
in water bodies, and can direct you to HAB-free beach areas near
you!
Develop a tool that alerts beach-goers to the precautions
they need to take before heading out to the shores.
-Predict their sun exposure based on:
The time of the day, and thus the distance from the sun, and
the angle of the sunâ€™s rays
The location of the beach (latitude, altitude, etc.)
The month of the year, and thus the position of the Earth
relative to the sun
The cloudiness of the sky
-Suggest alternative times of the day, or days when sun exposure
levels are lower.
-Warn users of presence of HABs in local beaches, and direct them
to safer regions, where available.
-Add other precautionary and safety alerts as you see fit!
